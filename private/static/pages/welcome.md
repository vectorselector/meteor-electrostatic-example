This is a "static" page generated with Electrostatic!

Electrostatic generates mongoDB database collections and content from static
files in the private/static directory of your Meteor app.

You can generate any document-based contents with this awesome new
Meteor package. It works perfectly with iron-router and fast-render
so your website won't feel sluggish!

And as a side effect of using Meteor you get one of the fastest
static development cycles ever. Hit enter in any document and
see the results immediately update in the browser!
