===================================

Electrostatic is a package the generates database content from static files
in the `private/static` directory of your Meteor app. You can generate any content
like blog posts, product descriptions, static pages etc. Use it with FastRender
and and iron-router and you might rule the world in a few days ;-)

See it live on Heroku: [Electrostatic Page with FastRender](http://electrostatic-example-app.herokuapp.com/)

This example is only a tech demo, no design beauty inside. 
But if you understood what it means, you will find it quite sexy!
